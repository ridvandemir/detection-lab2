# detection-lab2

Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within Splunk, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

Tools Used

- Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Suricata for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
